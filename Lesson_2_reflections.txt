What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    A hidden .git directory is created. You need the directory for git
    to do what it does, track your commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    It's different from the working area in that it's where you place files
    that will soon be committed. The working area files are either not tracked
    or have no changes to them that warrant a consideration to be committed.
    The staging area is also different from the repository in that these files
    have not yet been committed and they could be a grouping of several files
    that you'd like to all be associated with one commit as opposed to many
    individual commits per file that don't reflect the linked changes between
    files which created the need for the commit to begin with.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

    You can stage multiple files in case the logical change requires multiple
    files.
