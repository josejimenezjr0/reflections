When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If you're offline, using multiple machines, or are working with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because you may not want the commits to be public until several commits
    are made together.
